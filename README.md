# Modeling and Analyzing Consumer Behavior

*Modeling and Analyzing Consumer Behavior* is a course I took during my Master's in the summer term 2019. The aim of this course was to learn fundamental methods, algorithms and concepts for analyzing consumer data. In adddition, this course teaches to write applications in R and to execute larger data mining and general data analytics projects. A case study and computer exercises, particularly in the areas of e-commerce and behavioural economics, were carried out to deepen these foundations.

The case study happened in teams of three and the resulting work can be found in this repository. Within the scope of this case study two data sets from an economical experiment at KIT's [KDÂ²-Lab](https://www.kd2lab.kit.edu/english/index.php) have been evaluated. Participants had two perform two tasks (one mathematical and one text based) each in three rounds. Meanwhile, participants were asked to complete a survey on their condition and physiological data were collected. Accordingly, the following two data sets were produced:

  1) survey data with measures on different items
  2) aggregated heart data for each participant
  
Finally, the goal of both experiment and exercise is to find root causes or best environments for participants to work in flow.
