# Modeling and Analyzing Consumer Behavior

*Modeling and Analyzing Consumer Behavior* is a course I took during my Master's in the summer term 2019. The aim of this course was to learn fundamental methods, algorithms and concepts for analyzing consumer data. In adddition, this course teaches to write applications in R and to execute larger data mining and general data analytics projects. To deepen these foundantials a case study and computer exercises, especially in the areas of e-commerce and behavioral economics were conducted.

The case study happened in teams of three and the resulting work can be found in this repository.
